# SKillTechnologiesTask1 (Timeout error observables)


The data from the API is being displayed in 33ms...So in order to show the timeout error I have given the timeout as 18ms..
We can check the error in our console where it shows the error message.

So if the observable is not able to fetch the response with in the given time we will be showing the error message time out in our console.
